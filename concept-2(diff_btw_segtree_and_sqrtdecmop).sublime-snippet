    <content><![CDATA[I assume you're talking about the RSQ (Range Sum Query) problem where we can change one point at time. I'll talk about this particular problem a little and then go to more general case.

They are not interchangeable.
Let's assume that you have M retrievals and K updates on N elements.
If M«K, sqrt-decomposition is better, because it will work in O(MN--v+K) which is less than O((M+K)logN) in that case.
However, it's more popular to have nearly similar amount of updates and retrievals in competition problems. So, segment tree because much better. For example, if N=1'000'000, then single retrieval with sqrt-decomposition will take ˜1000 operations, while segments tree will need 20 only - 50 times faster!]]></content>
